Trying to make a tool to assist writing security reports. Because I hate writing them. The reports
will have a template system in MarkDown+LaTeX so you can edit colors, images and whatnot for your company. I will also
make a database of vulnerabilities so you dont have to write the description/impact everytime, and
you can use them on the reports like a template string "$xss['description']".

Basically :

1. New/Open Template
2. Write Report
3. Add Vulns $xss['CVSS']
4. Export to PDF/WhatEver

# Features
* Report templates
* Vulnerabilities descriptions
* PDF Render

# Usage flow
